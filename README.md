# SCA Frontend Take Home Test

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for your time to take this coding test. Please read the following instructions carefully.

The **challenge** is to complete the 'Category' Page according to the design mocks.

This task **should take no longer than a coupe of hours** to complete & is here to assess your ability to write Javascript, HTML and CSS in a real world scenario.

## Getting Started
The project has been completely setup for you, including the page routes, and API calls. Therefore, the code you need to write is minimal.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

You will need Node.js version `10.13` or later.

- Navigate to the `front-end-take-home` directory in your terminal
- Install the dependencies `npm install`
- Start the development server `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser, and you should see the home page.

You can also open storybook `npm run storybook` to check out some of the components already built.

## Requirements

Complete the `Category` Page (To get there, click on one of the categories on the Home Page).

- The layout should be responsive and match the mocks (4 columns on desktop, 3 on tablet, 2 on mobile).
- The page should visually match the mocks as closely as possible.
- The show name of the Card should be truncated to a single line.
- The description of the Card should be truncated to 3 lines.
- The page only needs to work on the *latest Chrome version*.
- Commit early and often, so that we can see how problems are solved.

#### Bonus round!
- Add a button for ascending and descending sorting to the listings according to `design-mocks/mock-sort.png`. (If you still have time)

## Tips
- Review the mocks in `design-mocks` directory. There is a mock design for desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile.
- The logical order to complete the tasks are:
  - Build the Show Card component.
  - Render the Show cards on the Category Page.
  - Make it responsive.
  - Add alphabetical sorting (If you still have some spare time).
- You do not need to build everything from the scratch. You can reuse the components already built in this app if you want.

## How to submit

- Push the results to some remote source control (like Git).
- Email the repository link to your point of contact.

Good luck,

The SCA Digital Team
